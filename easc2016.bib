abstract = "Efficient solution of the Navier–Stokes equations in complex domains is dependent upon the availability of fast solvers for sparse linear systems. For unsteady incompressible flows, the pressure operator is the leading contributor to stiffness, as the characteristic propagation speed is infinite. In the context of operator splitting formulations, it is the pressure solve which is the most computationally challenging, despite its elliptic origins. We examine several preconditioners for the consistent \{L2Poisson\} operator arising in the PN−PN−2 spectral element formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We develop a finite element-based additive Schwarz preconditioner using overlapping subdomains plus a coarse grid projection operator which is applied directly to the pressure on the interior Gauss points. For large two-dimensional problems this approach can yield as much as a fivefold reduction in simulation time over previously employed methods based upon deflation. "

abstract="Fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNSs) have been performed with a high-order spectral element method to study the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid in a smooth circular pipe of radius R and axial length 25R in the turbulent flow regime at four different friction Reynolds numbers Re                                          $\tau$                \thinspace=\thinspace180, 360, 550 and                                                                           \$1{\backslash}text\{,\}000\$                . The new set of data is put into perspective with other simulation data sets, obtained in pipe, channel and boundary layer geometry. In particular, differences between different pipe DNS are highlighted. It turns out that the pressure is the variable which differs the most between pipes, channels and boundary layers, leading to significantly different mean and pressure fluctuations, potentially linked to a stronger wake region. In the buffer layer, the variation with Reynolds number of the inner peak of axial velocity fluctuation intensity is similar between channel and boundary layer flows, but lower for the pipe, while the inner peak of the pressure fluctuations show negligible differences between pipe and channel flows but is clearly lower than that for the boundary layer, which is the same behaviour as for the fluctuating wall shear stress. Finally, turbulent kinetic energy budgets are almost indistinguishable between the canonical flows close to the wall (up to y                        \thinspace+\thinspace\thinspace≈\thinspace100), while substantial differences are observed in production and dissipation in the outer layer. A clear Reynolds number dependency is documented for the three flow configurations.",

pages="139--167",
abstract="A new formulation for the numerical solution of low Mach number compressible flow problems is presented and analyzed. In this formulation the thermal part (energy and species equations) is solved implicitly and decoupled from the momentum equation, whereas the hydrodynamic part (momentum-continuity) is advanced in time using a high order splitting approach which results in overall high order accuracy in time and minimal errors in mass conservation. These errors are analyzed using both analytical tools and benchmark numerical examples. Results from two-dimensional simulations with one-step global reaction in opposed jet flame and porous particle configurations are also presented.",
